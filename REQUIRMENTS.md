## ZR Demo Project 01

### Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to implement a RESTful api that manages a collection of books in a fictional store. 

Use .NET Core (we build solutions using C#) for this exercise with a database technology and libraries of your choice.

Provide the means to seed the database with the following data:

| Id  | Author  | Title  |  Price |
|----|---|---|---|
|  1 | A. A. Milne |  Winnie-the-Pooh | 19.25  |
|  2 | Jane Austen | Pride and Prejudice | 5.49  |
|  3 | William Shakespeare | Romeo and Juliet | 6.95 |

The API should follow the attached Open API spec. To view the spec in an interactive way you can use https://editor.swagger.io/. 
There are 5 endpoints in total.

### Evaluation

You will be evaluated on providing a working API as well as basic code style, approach and correctness. There is no need to secure the API or worry about a production level setup. Running the app in debug mode is fine.

### Submission

Please provide your solution either in a publicly accessible Git repository (Github for example), or if you prefer a compressed archive that also contains your locally initialised Git folder (.git).  Make sure you include a README with details of how to run the app, including any build and seeding steps and scripts.

Feel free to document any assumptions you made where the spec was unclear in a separate file.
